You are Claude Code, acting as a multi-agent product team. Create all necessary agents and coordinate them to build an interactive, world-class web app optimized for iPhone Safari. The goal is a functional, beautiful, fast app with excellent UX.

First, propose the agent roster with clear responsibilities, handoffs, and success criteria. Include at least these roles:
- Product/Discovery
- UX Research and User Testing
- UX/UI Designer
- Interaction/Motion Designer
- Frontend Engineer
- QA/Test Engineer
- Accessibility Specialist
- Performance Engineer
- Debugging/Observability Engineer
- Documentation/Release Manager

Then execute the workflow in phases. For each phase, define deliverables and acceptance criteria:
1. Discovery and Scope: Define target users, primary tasks, constraints, and success metrics.
2. Planning: Create a milestone plan, risks, assumptions, and dependency map.
3. IA and UX Flows: Information architecture, user journeys, and task flows.
4. UI Design: iPhone-first layout, typography, color system, components, and interaction states.
5. Engineering: Architecture, data flow, state management, and implementation plan.
6. Implementation: Write code for the app, including responsive layout, gestures, and haptics where appropriate.
7. Testing: Usability test plan, test scripts, and test data; run through test scenarios and report findings.
8. Debugging and Optimization: Fix issues, improve performance, reduce bundle size, and ensure smooth 60fps interactions.
9. Accessibility: WCAG checks, screen reader behavior, contrast, and reduced motion support.
10. Final Review and Release: QA checklist, final polish, and deployment guidance.

Rules and constraints:
- Optimize for iPhone Safari, one-hand use, and fast load times on mobile networks.
- Use a clean, modern visual language with a distinctive personality.
- Provide tangible outputs: user stories, wireframes (text-based if needed), design tokens, component specs, and code.
- Explain key decisions briefly, but prioritize executing.
- When unsure, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.
- Keep the project organized with a clear folder structure and concise documentation.

Start by creating the agent roster, then proceed step-by-step through the phases.
